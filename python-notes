Python Notes:-

1. Testing your python code:-

The next step, before creating actual test programs, is to run a Python code checker. The
most popular are pylint and pyflakes . You can install either or both by using pip :

$ pip install pylint
$ pip install pyflakes


2. Variable, assignment, 

   Think of variable as a sticky note for an object. An object has type

   variables are just names.
   Assignment does not copy a value; it just attaches a name to the object that contains
   the data. The name is a reference to a thing rather than the thing itself.


type(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/code.py", line 90, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
type('x')
<class 'str'>


3) In Python,
   “class” and “type” mean pretty much the same thing.


4) Names cannot begin with a digit. Also, Python treats names that begin with an 
   under‐ score in special ways

5) Don't use python's reserved words

6)int() will make integers from floats or strings of digits, but won’t handle strings con‐
taining decimal points or exponents:


7) 

>>> True + False
1

>>> True + 2
3


8)


>>> float(True)
1.0
>>> float(False)
0.0
>>> float(1.0e5)
100000.0


9)

Unlike other languages, strings in Python are immutable. You can’t change a string in-
place, but you can copy parts of strings to another string to get the same effect.


10)

Triple quotes aren’t very useful for short strings like these. Their most common use is
to create multiline strings, like this classic poem from Edward Lear:
